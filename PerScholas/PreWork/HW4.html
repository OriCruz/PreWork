	<p id="intro">I'm from Venezuela, but I moved to the U.S. with my parents in 2018. I speak both English and Spanish fluently. <br>
	I recently graduated with an Associates Degree in software development this past May. I have a green parakeet, her name is Aspen. <br>I like building lego sets, read, draw, and watch movies/shows on my free time. I enjoy swimming and going to the beach. <br> I'm a big fan of the <a href ="https://www.marvel.com/movies" >MCU</a>,  <a href ="https://www.wizardingworld.com/">Harry Potter</a>, and <a href ="https://www.timburton.com/" >Tim Burton's flims.</a>
	<br> Here are a couple of my favorite quotes from each fandom:<br>
	<br><q id="Quotes">The city is flying and we’re fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense.</q>
	~Clint Barton, Avengers the Age of Ultron~
	<br>
	<br><q id="Quotes">If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.</q>
	~Sirius Black, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire~
	<br>
	<br><q id="Quotes">Everything in this room is edible. Even I'm edible. But, that would be called canibalism. It is looked down upon in most societies.</q>
	~Tim Burton, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory~
